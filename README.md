# Trip Planner Developer Docs

Virtual Environment Notes:
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) is used to manage dependencies. The expectation is that people will create a Python virtual environment with pyenv and then run some poetry commands to install packages into the virtual environment. For instance, if things are set up correctly, developers can run ```pyenv exec poetry shell``` and then ```poetry install``` in their terminal and all project dependencies will be installed.
