That is a great time to stock up on shoes especially if you have a coupon on top of that.   \\n\\nOther reviewers have complained about the return policy and I must say that I have never attempted to return anything at this store so I can't really comment on that.  I guess that is just something to be aware of before making a purchase.  \\n\\nThis store also may not have your size for the shoe you want but they can usually order it for you and have it delivered to the store or your house.  I haven't ordered a shoe this way but employees have alerted me to this service. \\n\\nI'd recommend going here for a good price on shoes.  They have men's and women's and kids shoes as well as casual, athletic, and formal shoes.  If you don't find anything here, there is always DSW next door.\",\n",

They don't interrupt your shopping experience to ask if you need anything when you clearly are doing just fine. They get you through the register in a jiffy.\\n\\nDefinitely join the rewards program - I have a $5 credit every 2nd or 3rd time I go there. I believe they send a birthday reward, too.\",\n",

I asked her why I\\'am I being just now notified about this not when ordering. She tells me I need to call paypal and see if they can help me.

I have only a password with paypal that\\'s all is required. I waited to get email and Sign up for 4 digit code nobody else requires.

She looked surprised, said it, then said, \"Im glad I remembered it.\" \\n      I inquired about excluding L\\'Chor Dodi. The Rabbi emailed me to say that they have a very short Fri service (none on Sat morn) because members \"had a short attention span.\" \"In April they had added a prayer to it so they had to cut a prayer out.\" Are these people so ignorant, they do not know the significance of their act for a Fri night service?\\n      I volunteered to participate in Adult Ed, also run by the Cantor. I was informed that their next speaker would be a Police Chief talking about \"Profiles in Courage\" (the JFK title).

I called the local store again - once again got terrible customer service - asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was not available.  I asked for the manager to return my call - the rep on the line did not even ask for my name.  I asked who would be returning my call - \"Jeff.\"  Jeff who? I asked - \"Jeff Peckman\".  Do you think that Jeff Peckman returned my call?  NOPE.  Terrible service - I will not be shopping at that store ever again.

The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you\\'re welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it\\'s late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can\\'t be bothered to help customers than you shouldn\\'t be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy.

On a recent trip, I got a couple of cute tops and a pair of stretchy skinny jean crops all for under $35 including tax.

The jacket was from a circular rack with a very large red placard labeled $30. It was black and they were three other black ones on the rack. However it did not have a $30 sticker on the tag like the same jacket in other colors on the rack, but there were the same black jackets hanging on the wall that were not on sale.  We thought there was a good chance it was not $30 so when I walked up we told him that we got it off the $30 rack, but was it really $30?  My daughter was prepared to pay the $60 price, but we wanted to clarify. He stepped out from behind the counter and looked over at the rack and said, \" oh, those jackets are just starting at $30.\" It didn\\'t look that way from the big sign. That was probably not true, But an associate probably just put them back on the wrong rack after emptying out the changing rooms.. I said \"OK, but that is misleading so maybe you can ask someone to move the other black ones up to the wall for the sake of other customers. \"I think this offended him because at that point he turned away and would not look up and did not respond when I said again, \"it\\'s just kind of misleading.\"  Then I was sure he was ignoring me because he wouldn\\'t look up at us, so I said his name from his name tag and I asked if he heard me. At that point, I definitely was verging on being rude myself, but I was so shocked that he was completely ignoring me as a customer service person at the counter of a retail store that I couldn\\'t resist asking him if he heard me.

Theres a great dodgeball court, 2 basketball hoops, and 4 of the extreme jump tramps.

I texted back our RSVPs and informed all of our guests of the change. \\nLess than 24 hours later I walked into Altitude to find that the tables I picked out were already decorated with our decorations. They had places set. They provided the pizza, water and utensils. It went from a stressful situation instantly to the easiest party we\\'ve ever hosted. In all, I think we had 26 kids attend. Everyone had a great time. Everything went smoothly. I thought it a little pricey but just like Tiana said \"trust me, it\\'s worth it\". I couldn\\'t agree more. We\\'ll be having more parties here.

Also, I think we were charged for ten kids and only seven came. Before this was always adjusted down, and honestly they were so busy I didn't want to stand there and go through the pricing. Even with this feedback, I give them five stars. My kids love it, makes it easy for me, the price is high - ish, but better than my boise getting trashed for a party!\\n\\nEdited to add: the company contacted me and gave us some one hour jump passes to make up for the extra charge of no-show jumpers!

This is a very large space with numerous different areas/ activities. \\n\\nThey have a large open jump area with long trampolines as well as smaller square, individual trampolines.  Very fun to run from one trampoline to the next. They have a fun area with a rotating arm that you have to jump over-- made me feel like I was a contestant on that old TV show \"Wipeout\" lol. They have a section with jousting, a rock wall, and monkey bars. Next to that is a really nice dodgeball area, and in the back of the building there are multiple foam pits with various things to jump off of (they even have a trapeze!!). They also have basketball hoops, walls to run up, and a fun game where you have to hit a bunch of light up buttons while jumping around.\\n\\nMaybe it was just because this place was new, but Altitude was extremely clean, and didn\\'t smell like a gross old gym. They also have attendants at various places in the facility monitoring jumpers for safety. Jumping around gets very exhausting so a one-hour jump window was just enough to check everything out. They also have a really good playlist that is blasting nice & loud throughout the facility, which makes it extra fun to jump around. :) I was highly satisfied with this place & it is an awesome activity to do on a cold afternoon when you feel like you\\'ve been cooped up in the house too long!

The process to join in on the fun includes signing a waiver and wearing their custom grip socks.   The kids keep the socks when they leave.  \\n\\nThe activities centered around the trampoline theme of the place but they had activities like foam pits, dodge ball court, climbing games, jumping games, etc..  Lots to do for all ages.  As a non participating parent, I was able to follow my little one around and it was fine just in my regular socks. \\n\\nThe party included pizza and cake, then the kids could go back and play.  By noon, the place was so crowded that we were glad to leave.   Overall a fun activity for a few hours.  \\n\\nI have no idea of the pricing structure.  What I can comment on is the place has easy parking, it's clean, the attendants are pleasant and not overbearing but present, plus it seems it's food friendly as there are places to sit and eat (not sure if they sell snacks??).

I have never experienced such callous disregard from any well-known company. Mayven and HerImports are accessible and communicative with me. Even Aliexpress has excellent follow-up. The Diamond Virgin Hair Company team runs away and hides when a critique is made. Their product is not perfect. They are selling hair that is grown from other human beings. It will never be perfect, and some customers will have varying experiences while wearing your product. That should be expected, and there should be a plan in place to deal with such occurrences.

However, you all cannot negate the concerns of customers after accepting payment. They have no right to treat customers in this manner, and they cannot continue this practice. This behavior is why Diamond Hair Company is not number #1, and it must be corrected if they ever wish to be. \\n\\nThe BBB must investigate these types of companies. Diamond Virgin Hair Company pays reviewers of social media to lure unsuspecting customers to their website. This company communicated with me about purchasing hair, but when the conversation became an inquiry about the quality of the hair that I received, the communicated ceased.

I commented that I've joined LA Fitness and it's cheaper than my Gold's membership and it includes 15+ classes a week. Another great thing about their classes is that 3 of the instructors I've had so far are former instructors at Gold's. Kenny shrugged his shoulders and said ok.

A so called youth medium uniform meant to fit girls in grade PK-2 fit like a huge sack while the small was tight yet the staff insisted the size was correct ( it did fit my 8th grader though but would have been a little too short ).  Another quality issue concerns the color consistency of some of the polo shirts.  One purchased earlier looked nice while at a later date when looking for more shirts, the same color looked faded.

We then moved onto the visitor's center for much-needed seats in air conditioning where he talked about voodoo and its part in the history of New Orleans. Unfortunately, we took this tour on our last day there and had to leave it early to get to the airport, so we missed the tour of Louis Armstrong Park. \\n\\nI highly recommend Spirit Tours. I know there's a lot of options, but they really do a great job and employ very knowledgeable and affable guides.\",\n",
       " \"This was an unplanned excursion. We happened to be walking by and saw the sign. The tour lasted an hour and hit a lot of the local points of interest. Our guide was knowledeable, which is why I'm giving this tour 3 stars, but her delivery sucked, which is why this tour is BARELY getting 3stars. Our guide spoke so fast that I thought we were at a cattle auction. Another problem was that this was supposed to be a haunted walking tour. I would have expected the guide to set the tone by telling her stories much in the same way you would tell ghost atories around a camp fire. Since she was talking like an auctioneer it was impossible to get that spooky feeling and so the tour missed it's mark.\",\n",

Not so much in the Ghost Tour as I was with the Cemetery /voodoo tour. \\n\\nThe Cemetery tour was ok; our guide wasn't a great story teller but got the point across.  I think we were spoiled by Confedereacy of cruisers tour we had taken the day before.  \\n\\nThe second day, the Ghost tour started off rocky when we showed up and our tour guide was disappointed it was just 2 of us (understandably), then tried to suggest we join another tour as once we get started (again, somewhat understandable), but when my boyfriend went to the ATM for money and his card was rejected by mistake,  I heard our guide walk outside and say to a friend in a smirky manner  that 'she not only had two people, but now and we can't even pull money out of the ATM' (NOT COOL!).  We thought cash was better since the other tours asked for cash only, but she treated us like second class people because we wanted to use cash and didn't charge it before hand . . . strange!! Maybe I should have charged her tip too . . .  I was close to just telling her we are good with not doing the tour! 3 more people showed up and her mood changed a bit.  The tour was ok, she was quite a character, the stories were interesting and she gives you history too.  \\n\\nI personally prefer tours that are told as a historical events and not scary stories, but I think younger kids and family would really enjoy this ghost tour!\",\n",

His pithy comments about New Orleans, the St. Louis Cemetery #1, and voodoo made the two hour tour entertaining, informative, and captivating.

The best thing about the tour was Adam's passion for history, cemeteries, and for the city itself, even with all of its faults. It was really affecting. Adam was really easy-going and approachable, and he often stopped what he was saying to answer any questions that popped up.\\n\\nHe ended the tour by bringing our group to the Voodoo Spiritual Temple on Rampart Street across from the famous Congo Square.

Whether or not you believe in ghosts is secondary, this tour takes you back and forth into various parts of the French Quarter and back .\\n\\ni saw mansions, convent and business that are supposedly haunted but most of all we had a good walk and lots of laughs.

He was right! A lovely woman- but  a bit of a wacko.. she spoke nothing about voodoo. She went on and on about how far our country has come, a funeral she went to in another city, and where everyone was from, but nothing about voodoo.

He goes in to a lot of historical detail and really knows his stuff. He was very nice and always willing to answer questions the best he could. If he didn't know the answer he would say he didn't know instead of making some crap up. He also seemed very plugged in to the community which was cool as well cause he could give personal stories. I learned a lot about what voodoo actually is and not the Hollywood version. Very interesting. \\nThe ghost tour was our favorite. It is not the made theatrical crap some of the other tour companies seem to do. I would much rather have someone like George give me the documented factual accounts rather than some 20something chick with piercings who pretends to be a vampire on the weekends bs.  If you do not believe in the paranormal take this tour and take lots of random pictures of the balconies. \\nWe had a great time on these tours and highly recommend this company.

I met up with Tiny, the awesome tour guide, and no one else showed up so he took me out on a private nighttime walking tour of the French Quarter.\\nO. M. G. I was sooo scared the whole time! In a good way. Tiny has the most incredibly detailed stories and amazing historical facts. What a memory! The whole time I felt like I was reading a book. That's how detailed he was. There were moments that I was so creeped out though that I had to ask him to not share any more details lol I didn't know how I was going to sleep that night. I think he was also helping make up for the fact that my previous tour with another guide was not great. Which I so appreciate!

George was our guide, and he gave us the history and accounts of sightings without sensationalism. While being a believer himself, he discounted the legends that he believed didn't make sense, and it did a lot for his credibility. It was intended to be more informative than dramatic, and I appreciated learning more about the city and some of the seriously disturbing thing that have happened here (a la The Human Centipede). As a skeptic myself, the sheer number of reporting sighting did give me pause. All in all, it was very interesting and worth the time and money.\",\n",

He waited for everyone to catch up, pointed out all the famous tombs and unique architecture style of the tombs, and answered all our questions. Before the end of the tour, he offered to bring us to see Princess Miriam (a famous voodoo practitioner), unfortunately she was sick that day.

I had a lot of friends recommend a graveyard tour for those reasons. Most of those were during the day time and I was in the area for work. The bus and tour guide was nice. The pickup location was convenient. However, this was definitely more of history guide than a ghost history/ sightings and stories. Only about 2 ghost stories/ history on a 2 hour narrated bus ride. The visits to the gravesites were cool and we got to visit the hurricanes Katrina memorial as well. Biggest reason I rated this tour so low is because of the people. They were ALL SO DRUNK. Because they allowed drinks on the ride and it was a 930 tour I did, everyone was so wasted. They were obnoxious. Had to make others wait for a unplanned bathroom stop because they were so wasted. Then to top it all off there was a verbal nasty fight between some passage we because someone stole their seat. They were being verbal on the bus and talking crap to each other when we got off of the bus for the tour stops.  Extremely inappropriate and I was surprised the tour guide did not address the situation. It was really bad at one point and he did not follow through and send them home on a Uber like he said he would in the beginning for not following the bus tour rules. I would not recommend this tour to anyone.',\n",

And luckily guy had insurance AND pulled over to give info. (yes Hit and Runs happen even in Paradise)\\nWent to one place for an estimate, but didn't seem busy and as professional bit 'rough around edges' let say.\\n\\nWent down street and found Iron Horse.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  \\nCraig greeted me as I came in. Nice man in a tie and dress shirt. We chatted a few minutes about V -Town (Ventura) and football. Very amiable man.\\n\\nWhat struck me, which I told him, was the array of cars behind the glass window and the fellas working on them. Yes they needed repairs, but for as many cars and guys as there were it didn't come off as a oily auto shop. (not that there is anything wrong with that of course!)\\n\\nService: Excellent. I knew they would have it for several days. And it was finished on the day he estimated. Also dealt with the insurance company which I appreciated.\\n\\nPricing: I really didn't do any comparison to be honest. In truth the insurance was handling it.\\n\\nSummary:\\nI passed by the car when I came back to pick it up. Why? It looked: So- Damn- Good. The bumper was new, paint exactly matched what I had. Absolutely recommend Craig and Iron Horse, for anyone but especially ladies.\",\n",

       " \"I was rear ended on the 101 Freeway in January of this year, and I had my car towed to Iron Horse Auto Body for the repairs. It was a big job that was paid for by the other driver's insurance, but Craig and his team at Iron Horse always treated me like the one who was paying and did an excellent job repairing the damage.  I was very pleased with the experience and would certainly have brought a vehicle back to him, but then something happened that really showed what a great business Iron Horse is:\\n\\nA couple of weeks ago I started to notice a musty smell in my car, and I discovered that the carpet behind the passenger seat was soaking wet. I thought that maybe there had been some damage to the car from the accident in January that wasn't immediately apparent, but the little bit of rain we have had in Santa Barbara combined with taking my car to the car wash a few times had exposed a leak somewhere. So I took my car back to Iron Horse on Monday morning to see if the leak could be related to the rear end accident. Craig said that he thought it was highly unlikely, but he told me that he would take a look to confirm just to make sure they hadn't missed anything. At this point I was feeling pretty disappointed because if the leak was unrelated to the accident, I would be footing the bill to do the repair. \\n\\nAs he had assumed, the leak was not coming from anything related to the accident, but he didn't stop there. He had his guys take apart the whole interior and dry out the wet carpet and pad while he searched online to try to figure out the source of the leak. Eventually they determined that the leak was actually caused by leaves that had blocked a drain behind the front right wheel. They cleared out the leaves, let my car dry out over night, and then put everything back together. I came back Tuesday afternoon and the car was reassembled and cleaned inside and out, and Craig insisted that there was NO CHARGE!\\n\\nSuffice it to say, I will only be taking my cars to Iron Horse Auto Body from now on, and I'll send all my friends as well.\",\n",

But, look at the quality and where it comes from and you can reason the price tag for a nice \"treat yourself\" moment every now and then. \\n\\nI particularly loved looking through the tons and tons of items throughout the store - body products, cologne, hair and beard grooming, clothes, shoes, bikes and gear, and the list goes on and on. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in the area, make the trip and give it a shot.

As a result, the next stop on Mom's retail therapy trip that the wife and I were taking her on was Saks Fifth Avenue.  Apparently my mom has been using the same Estee Lauder stuff for decades.   I'm clueless about women's makeup and the latest technology, but according to the wife, she needed to find something that suited her better.  Saks had the full complement of cosmetic options to choose from, to include her usual Estee Lauder products.  Enter Erin, the friendly salesperson working the Armani counter, who approached us and asked if she could assist us.  She was very patient and reassuring with my mom.  She listened to what she wanted to achieve with her makeup, and then proceeded to recommend some products and apply makeup on her.  Mom, somewhat hesitant of change, seemed happy with the results.  We bought the makeup and some brushes to apply and left for home.  What made the trip to Saks a 5-star experience was that when we got home, my dad, without any prompting, complimented Mom on her appearance, which made her happy and visibly lifted her spirits.  For that, it was worth all of the time and effort dragging my mom through countless stores on a Friday afternoon.\",\n",

       " 'I would like to file a formal complaint regarding your physical store location in Indianapolis, Indiana at the Fashion Mall. About two months ago, I went upstairs to browse dresses and women\\'s work suits and was confronted by one of the rudest employees I\\'ve ever met. I didn\\'t catch her name because of trying to social distance (and she didn\\'t introduce herself) but it was an older blonde woman with a thick accent. She kept following me around, everywhere I went, not in a helpful or friendly way, but in an \"I\\'ve got my eyes on you\" way. It was so embarrassing. She eventually came straight up to me (disregarding social distancing), grabbed the clothes out of my hands, and announced they would be in a dressing room. Didn\\'t ask me, didn\\'t slowly approach me, didn\\'t even tell me where she was taking them. I then went to go find this dressing room, and she got angry that I didn\\'t know where it was at. Um, sorry? Then, the whole time I was trying stuff on, she was standing right outside the door, rushing me along. It was so rude that I just gave up and left. I handed over all my clothes minus a package of hoosiery because I needed some. Before I purchased them, I wanted to look at perfume, and she followed me to the escalator and ripped them out of my hands screaming, \"What are you doing?!?\" It scared the crap out of me. She scolded me that I wasn\\'t allowed to look at anything else until I bought my hoosiery first, I wasn\\'t allowed to carry it around, and how dare I try to walk away with it. In front of strangers, she treated me like a criminal as if I was trying to steal something. Which makes no sense, especially because I was dressed extremely well, just had my hair done, wearing my diamond jewelry, AND in a close-fitting dress complete with a tiny purse. Where the heck would I have put it? She left me in tears. I\\'ve encountered plenty of not-so-friendy employees here at Saks, but this horrible woman takes first place for being the most disrespectful. What\\'s worse is that I called the office to tell them of my experience - they weren\\'t there, so I left a voicemail - and they never returned my call or got back with me. So the problem appears to work up its way to management as well, they simply didn\\'t care. I have no problem spending good money on high-quality clothes, I work hard and need nice work suits. I literally just got my graduate degree and am a young professional. This was a despicable experience, both management and this particular employee should be ashamed of themselves for how they treated a quiet, well-mannered guest just trying to buy some business attire.',\n",

Originally is what the manager said. Then come to find out the woman was supposed to overnight ship my bag and took two weeks to send my bag off. After speaking to the manager Sarah, who is the manager at LV as well as a girl name Hannah. I will not be back. Worse customer service of life. The manager then proceeds to tell me that they handle everything with a case by case basis.

I asked for a supervisor & was put on hold; after 16 min. I hung up.  I called back & was told the wait for a supervisor was 1 hour & 39 min.  Are you kidding?  From a high-end store that would tout itself on its personal attentive service?  It was super UNimpressive from the second I tried to order online.  I would never shop there again.

       " 'Saks is the best place in town for conspicuous consumption. When you want to communicate that you have enough money to buy a $390 Balenciaga \"dad hat\" that is obviously cheap as dirt to make (I\\'ve ordered better made logo hats for around $8, so that\\'s a 4875% markup), this is your place.\\n\\nSometimes you pay for quality, but sometimes you just pay. I\\'ve heard that the intrinsic value and satisfaction that people associate with an item goes up the more they pay for it, and you can certainly test that theory here. But frankly, that dad hat just made me laugh out loud at the audacity of it all. It takes some serious gumption to overcharge that outrageously.\\n\\nStill, there\\'s a place for peacocking to show your social status, I suppose. No one will try to run you out of the store if it\\'s obvious you choose to make more practical shopping choices and are just a shopping tourist, but don\\'t expect friendly service either. Aloof is about the best you can expect from the staff here. But to be honest I would rather shop without people fawning all over me, so that suits me just fine.\\n\\nFrankly, I don\\'t really have to try to be unimpressed at the best of the brands available here, but I\\'m a practical Midwestern girl that chooses to spend her money on different things, so I\\'m not exactly the target market. It is true that people are judged by strangers partly on what they wear, but that little fact cuts both ways. If I ever see anyone in that Balenciaga hat I\\'m going to judge the heck out of them, and not in a good way.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Fendi, Balenciaga, Chanel, Rag n Bone etc. this is pretty much the only game in town. The perfumes and colognes are unusual and worth a stop if you want to find a signature scent that not everyone has encountered before.

A tech called to confirm the appointment and we got a text asking to confirm. We confirmed both with both routes of contact. We show up at 9am for our appointment and there's a sign on the door to call a number to check in and someone will come and get your pet.

We stood at the counter until 10am when they apparently opened fully. I understand that COVID-19 has made things difficult for businesses. My father in law also brings his dog here and back in March had the same issue. He brought his dog here at 9am, waited until 10, and when the vet staff arrived they told him he didn't have an appointment. The new hours are posted outside the office, but we were scheduled at 9am by one of the hospital staff. If their appointment times have changed, why did they still schedule us at 9am and why did we not get a phone call asking to schedule or telling us the appointment time changed? The hospital's hours changed due to COVID-19 on 3-20-2020. We are now at April 26th, over a month later and we are still having issues. We will be looking elsewhere for care for our dog.

Lots of vintage comic books too.\\n\\nI've been to comic stores and to a somewhat similar place in Fishers, but this shop, though packed, seems more organized and easier to get around in.  There were lots of items I remember seeing 20-30 years ago.  Some were still in the packaging, but there were some just in plastic bags that were really affordable if you are looking for toys that kids can play with.  (Why pay for the packaging?)\\n\\nBut they had some items that, although maybe not in mint condition, were unique.  How about a life sized inflatable Jabba the Hut!  Or helmets of storm troopers or Boba Fett.  Ora cooler that looks like R2D2.  Yes, they had them!\\n\\nThe guys who work there were friendly and easy to talk to about the items.  Although I didn't make any purchases this day, I got some ideas I may pass along to my family for my birthday/Christmas.  Fun stuff!\\n\\nNote that this location is a little awkward to get to from the south.  I highly recommend cutting across Troy to Brill Street and then heading north from there because Madison angles and would be difficult to turn onto Brill from the south.  Southbound on Madison is no problem though...just watch for the street sign.\\n\\nReview #3305\",\n",

I could take it out, let it heal, and start over OR I could power through and hope for the best.  I opted to let it heal and start over.  When he took the jewelry out (which was the same piece that I was pierced with) he was quite shocked that a reputable place such as 805 would have pierced me with such a cheap piece of jewelry that had plastic on the backing.  Plastic harbors bacteria, and bacteria is something you absolutely want to avoid when getting pretty new holes jabbed into your body.\\n\\nSo, the lesson of the day here is: do not get pierced at 805!  \\n\\nIf you are brave enough to ignore my warning and decide to do so anyway, just make sure you get someone else and avoid the girl that pierced me.  I don't know her name, but if you see a youngish girl (in her early 20's I'm guessing) with long, straight hair approach you, run out the door or she will go amateur-hour on you!  \\n\\nNow I'm just going to hit the reset button, burn some sage and goosfrabba, and continue on with a real-deal piercer who knows how it goes.\",\n",
       " \"This review is for the piercing only.\\n\\nI got my tragus done here recently and it didn't exactly go smoothly.  There was so much pulling and snapping and tugging and popping, I never thought she'd finish.  Luckily for me I have a high threshold for pain.  I asked her what was going on there and she rattled off some noncoherent reason.  It looks nice even though it is not quite even with the piercing in my other ear, but holy hell, girl.  It felt like her very first rodeo and I was the unlucky guinea pig.  \\n\\nI got my other tragus done years ago someplace else and it was in and out.  Done.  Easy.  It even healed quickly, which I can't say for this one.  I usually find piercing to be enjoyable.\\n\\nAny future piercings of mine will be done elsewhere by someone more seasoned with experience.\",\n",

He was condescending when I first presented him with a picture of my idea, when he drew it it didn't resemble the type of art I wanted and I showed a picture of what I was picturing. Bad customer service and bad attitude. KI believe that getting a tattoo is 50% experience, 50% artwork. Both of which made me feel uncomfortable that I didn't agree with HIS art. The rest of he crew at 805 Ink(such as J.J.) was so cool and helpful when discussing what I wanted. Knox ruined the vibe of the whole experience.\",\n",

       " \"My fiancÃ©e and I walked in looking for one-shot souvenir tattoos. Below are two reviews, one for Jamison Stagaard and the other for Chadillac Green:\\n\\nOn Jamison Stagaard (@jamison_tattooer): I have had extensive work done by many great tattoo artists throughout California (Jason Kundell @ Art Work Rebels, Joey Armstrong @ Seventh Son Tattoo, Eddy Reyes @ Secret Sidewalk Tattoo, et al.). Jamison Stagaard hooked me up with a freehand, old school grim reaper on a funky space that needed filler. (Dope as f***!) Jamison was no frills and no gimmicks. He was a comical conversationalist with clean, bold line work. If you want a classic American traditional piece, then check out Jamison Stagaard. I plan to return and seek out Jamison for some other projects the next time I am in Santa Barbara. \\n\\nOn Chadillac Green (@chadillac_green): Quick, clean, and super professional, Chadillac killed it with recreating a memorial tattoo for a lost loved one. He was very accommodating and made the experience memorable as it was the four year anniversary of my niece's passing.\",\n",
       " \"I love this shop! Always a great experience. I have gone to Chadillac Green for six of my tattoos and he always blows me away with his perfect execution of dotwork. He listens to all your ideas and isn't afraid to let you know if an idea or placement won't work (so important!). \\n\\nJamison Stagaard started with a guess spot and I had to come in for some more work after seeing his portfolio. His work is fantastic! Love his use of colour and he respected all the previous work I've had done and that really played into where the piece would fit. Definitely will get more work from him. \\n\\nWith either artist you cannot go wrong!\",\n",

He got me & my daughter in right away. After mine was done- I could see that I'd need some touching up. After it was all healed-I called to schedule a touch up appointment-I still have not heard back. At this point-I'm disappointed in 805 Ink.\",\n",

Jamison Stagaard was a super cool guy and made me feel so comfortable while getting an uncomfortable foot tattoo. He made great conversation in the process, was super detailed and fast. Both of the artists weren't afraid to inform me of any placement or size issues, which is great because they're the professionals and in the long run, they'll know what's best. Definitely going back for a third sometime soon :)\",\n",

Furthermore, I still decided to come in and just want to point out that there was not even a welcoming vibe coming into the shop let alone being greeted was not even an option. Once I spoke to someone, not gonna shame this person but this has to be the dumbest question to of asked me, I\\'m sorry but just keep reading.. so even before I could explain what I wanted I was interrupted to be asked, \" are you sure you want it?\" I mean come on now.... why else would I be there spending my vacation at a tattoo shop if I\\'m not trying to get a tattoo that I wanted to get as a memorial for my friend who just passed away last year... SADLY, It doesn\\'t end there folks, so the artist who spoke to me said flat out, \" we won\\'t do the tattoo because I don\\'t have a full sleeve\". Which I totally respect but what I cant respect is the fact I was willing to get something else but the mood there just felt like they didn\\'t want me in there and as if I just came with $1000 to get told I can\\'t get what I want and then not be willing to work out something else for me.

       " 'Visited Santa Barbara from Los Angeles and my boyfriend really desired a tattoo [first one] to remind him of his father. We used YELP to help us locate the best tattoo parlor in Santa Barbara. Thanks to the reviews and images we decided to try 805 ink. \\n\\nThe tattoo parlor is clean. Each tattoo artist separates their station using curtain/partition. Chad, the tattoo artist, used clean utensils and was very careful during the process. My boyfriend had no idea the design he wanted for his first tattoo. Our tattoo artist gave him sample books to look through for inspiration. Thankfully, he only got a name, but was able to find the lettering/script using the sample book. \\n\\nOverall, we were highly satisfied with how steady the artist hand was, how slow he went, how he recognized it was his first tattoo and thus tried to be gentle. When the tattoo was complete he was able to purchase soap and lotion for aftercare. \\n\\nTwo weeks later and his tattoo healed very well. There was minimum peeling. My boyfriend, who lives in Los Angeles, prefers to travel back to 805 ink to get any future tattoos. \\n\\nThank you for the positive experience!\\n\\nI meant to note that they accept walk-ins. Thats what we did!',\n",
       " \"I've been meaning to post this for a while now. I moved to SB in 2014 and I was searching for a new artist. One of the more popular places in town I found the artists to be talented but the shop staff to be incredibly rude. I work hard for my money so when I spend it I would like it to be a good experience.  Other places in town the art I saw in portfolios and online looked subpar. Finally I came across 805's website and loved everyone's work that was posted on it. Chad's spoke to me the most because I just love the way he captures animals and I was in the market for a critter tattoo. I went in and made an appointment with him. Him and everyone who worked there has an approachable personality and were super helpful. I felt his price was really fair and I loved the work I got so I've been back for two more and counting. Chad is an artist through and through. He has his paintings hung up and other art he's created hung around his work station and also DJ's. So 10/10 would recommend 805 ink for your tattoo needs.\",\n",

I googled tattoo shops and 805 Ink showed up and I am so happy it did. I did a walk in and they were great. Jamison was the one who did my tattoo and when I told him what I was thinking of he immediately drew it out and it looked incredible. I even asked if he could make it a bit smaller and he made it exactly what I wanted in one try.\\n\\nThe tattoo is a olive branch on my foot with great shading in the leaves and while he was working he was asking me how I was doing making sure everything was going okay since the foot is a painful place. After he was done with my foot he then touched up my side tattoo I had gotten from another artist and he fixed it up better than it looked before.\\n\\nJamison is definitely precise in his work; he makes sure everything is quality. After finishing he went over proper care with me as well. \\n\\nOver all Jamison and 805 was great in helping me with my tattoo experience.

I was so impressed by my first piece and with the overall experience I had with Jake that I decided to get a second tattoo from him about a year later. He was extremely helpful with the artwork process, and each time he seemed genuinely excited about what I wanted, and equally as much to do the work.  From what I could tell about the rest of the artists, they share the same passion and professionalism. \\nBoth pieces held up great and continue to get compliments.

Since this was my first I was really nervous and picky, so it was really great that Chad didn't make me feel rushed and did such an amazing job.

I wanted some small lettering covered up with an Edward ScissorHands tattoo and what I got was Rosey O\\'donnell in a bad wolverine costume.\\n  Not only did Danny lose the drawing I had done of the design we had originally agreed upon but the rushed stencil he came up with made it extremely hard to tell what the end result would be. I didn\\'t get to see the awful comic book reference he used until it was too late. The one thing I had commented on about the stencil was how the hair needed to be more exaggerated but all Danny did was give Rosie a thicker perm. And the list goes on: There\\'s an odd turtle hump on Rosie\\'s back, the \"scissor hands\" look more like weird dinosaur claws, there\\'s two thumbs on the right hand, the left knee is upside down, and from the stencil it looked like length of it\\'s legs were going to be long but in reality the groin area is what got extended LONGER THEN THE TORSO!!\\n  I left the shop in tears and still get sick to my stomach everytime I have to look at it which is almost all the time because it\\'s on my FOREARM! I\\'m getting married in few months and hope to have a baby shortly after and now I have to live with this disaster in all my wedding photos the pictures of me holding my child which has made me extremely depressed. I did so much research on the artist I wanted that to be betrayed like this is literally heart breaking. Danny Meza only loses out on a returning customer where as I\\'m stuck with this humiliating ink stain that can\\'t be covered up or even removed by surgery without damaging my other tattoos.

       " 'On Sunday February 15, I came in with my boyfriend and two friends to get my first tattoo. I did not have an appointment, so when I asked the guy at the counter if anyone was available to do my tattoo I was told to come back in 45 minutes because they were busy with other people, which I was completely fine with. There were also two girls hanging out at the counter talking to the guy who worked there. I told the guy what I wanted to get tattooed and the two girls snickered at me. I just ignored them and left until it was time to return.\\n\\nI came back at the exact time when I was supposed to and stood at the front counter to wait to check back in. I saw a few girls and guys hanging out in the back and they were talking and hanging out. I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes, and no one came to the front to say anything. I decided to sit down and wait, and about 10 minutes later, JJ comes up to give me paperwork to fill out. He still did not greet us or mention anything about having us wait for so long. I was in the middle of talking to JJ about the tattoo I wanted, and some guy that knew him came into the shop and interrupted us. I then waited for about 5 more minutes as JJ caught up with his friend. I thought it was incredibly rude and exemplified bad customer service to push aside business with a customer to chat with his friend. \\n\\nOnce he printed out my tattoo he told me to go to the back and my friend asked if they could go with me. He said that only two people were allowed to go back with me. When we were walking to the back, I saw 3 girls and a couple guys all hanging out at one station while someone was getting tattooed and they were drinking beer. \\n\\nI was extremely nervous to get a tattoo, and I would think that a tattoo artist would at least say something like \"It\\'s not that bad\" or \"You\\'ll be okay\" to a first-timer, but JJ did not say anything. My friends instead comforted me and JJ remained silent. I thought the tattoo was painful, and I kept asking \"How much is left?\" (I got a small quote on my side) and JJ ignored me every time, and my boyfriend would have to look over to see how much was done. The only thing JJ said to me when I was getting it done was \"Don\\'t move.\" My tattoo was very small and simple, and I was very happy with the outcome. After it was finished JJ did not say anything like \"It looks good\" or even \"All done!\" I even thanked him and told him that I loved it and all he said was \"Yeah.\" \\n\\nWhen I went to pay, JJ did not give me any post-care instructions, never mind ask if I knew what to do after a tattoo. Luckily, all of my friends have tattoos so they were able to tell me what to do. Overall, even though I love the end result of my tattoo, the customer service at this place was horrible. JJ was incredibly unfriendly, and the staff was completely unprofessional having open containers of alcohol in the shop while someone was getting tattooed. If anyone were to ask me if they should get their tattoo there, I would strongly encourage them to get it done somewhere else if they are looking for a good experience.',\n",

The tattoo itself was painless and turned out pretty well.\\n\\nIt was a 2.5 hour session so halfway through, Chad wants to take a break outside. When he gets back, he tells me he just smoked some weed and then continues to keep working on me. I kind of laughed it off and I have zero issue with smoking weed, but mid-tattoo? Not okay with me at. What am I going to do though? Get up and walk with a half-finished tattoo? Needless to say I was extremely uncomfortable at this point.\\n\\nHis bedside demeanor was cold, rude, and unprofessional. He kept talking about \"f---ing\" this girl he was seeing. I tried to talk to him about art and he kept switching the subject back to women and drugs and partying. No talk about the tattoo, after care, if I was comfortable, etc. If this had been my first tattoo, it would have been unbearable.\\n\\nHe finishes, takes a picture outside, and slaps a bandage on haphazardly before I have a really good chance to look at it. He does such a bad job with the tape, it falls off the second I leave the shop.\\n\\nWhen I got home, I took a closer look and realized he missed branches on one of the trees in my tattoo!

The girl was nice and it was typical pain. But after, I\\'ll say, a week maybe? my ear was feeling itchy and I was noticing that the jewelry was leaving some type of green residue on my ear. I looked at the back of my ear and it looked like as if something was eating at the flesh of my ear!! It was so infected I started crying because of how terrible the infection look! Turned out that the green residue was due to the quality of the jewelry that 805 ink pierced my ear with....the jewelry was FAKE. When I called to complain...they told me they would refund me the money and said that it was a mistake from the seller that they received \"costume jewelry.\" How irresponsible and unprofessional???!!! They\\'re piercing people with fake costume jewelry!!!! What kind of reputation are you trying to uphold? If you can\\'t tell from the reviews...I\\'m not the only person with a bad piercing experience from this place. \\nand BTW, the infection was not do to poor care on my part.

Mine was a tiny basic black finger tattoo while my wife\\'s was a more elaborate black design that took a bit longer. Strangely no one discussed price upfront. The guy who did mine was cool and talkative, the one who worked on my wife was nice but much quieter. While mine took maybe 8 minutes max, and my wife\\'s took around 30, the pricing was nearly identical ($80 for a 1/2\" bird vs $100 for a half bracelet with 3 birds on a branch)  - we\\'re guessing because the guy who tattooed my wife was less experienced but we\\'re not sure. Anyhow, overall a good experience...BUT as my wife paid, we watched as a young Latino man came in and asked for one, the guys clearly take turns on who does walk-ins, and this tall smarmy tattoo guy who was there as well made it clear that he drew the short straw and loudly bitched about having to stay late to take care of this guy who wanted a tattoo. it was incredibly embarrassing to watch how rude this guy was about it and I know if I had been the prospect of customer that I would have walked out right then, or asked for someone else as that guy was behaving completely unprofessionally. and yes we commented right then and there how rude it was and nobody seemed to have a reaction. That being said, neither artist we worked with had a reaction when we said what our tattoos were for...hey guys, a little sensitivity goes a long way!',\n",

Was there with a younger friend who was also getting her first tattoo. \\n\\nBefore starting, I'd walked into the shop, and happened to meet Chad.

I told him what I was looking for and he answered some initial questions about how long it would take, etc. Then I sent him some photos over Instagram, and came back in to leave a deposit and make my appointment.\\n\\nYesterday, he started with my friend by replacing the stencil of her tattoo at least 5 times until he was super happy with the placement of it on her body, making sure the art would look good and hit the curves of her ribs/waist correctly. He didn't hurry through that part, which impressed me.\\n\\nI went next and was super happy with the experience: he was understanding of a first-timer's trepidation, made it lighthearted and fun, and explained every step of the process, making sure to ask how I was doing. I wasn't sure I was going to add color, so he did the lines first, then we took a break while I decided to do color and he got the colors ready, then he finished up. He was fast - my whole tattoo process probably didn't take 30 minutes even.\\n\\nMost importantly, the tattoo Chad designed for me was better than any picture I'd shown him. It was exactly what I was going for, only better. I love it.\\n\\nAfterward, he told us how to care for the tattoos, and told us not to buy the soap and lotion from the shop since it's cheaper at CVS, which is nice.\\n\\nLook, this is a tattoo shop and not a spa.

       " \"In my early days of independence as a young, disabled adult post-high school, I found myself living on the Near-Eastside of Indy in a recently renovated old school turned apartment building at 1417 East Ohio Street. I didn't live in the building very long, to be honest, because I struggled in those early years to acquire the independent living skills necessary to succeed. However, I fell in love with this side of town. It's where I met my wife and it's where I also met the very last person I dated not so long ago. \\n\\nYeah, this side of town has lingered in my life despite my having not lived in it for years. \\n\\nWillard Park is a Near-Eastside gem. Named after the founder of the Indiana School for the Deaf, Willard Park actually was the location of the original Indiana School for the Deaf in 1850. Now, it's an 11-acre park that used to be more known for the nearby prostitutes and run-down housing than as a place where children and families could truly relax, enjoy some recreation, and have a genuinely good time. \\n\\nAfter a $500,000 grant allowed for some significant upgrades, it seems like the entire area really followed suit. While it's still a fairly low-income area, it's a low-income area with a strong sense of community and pride and one that continues to be on the upswing with area businesses like The Neidhammer and Ash & Elm Cider joining others in contributing to the neighborhood's consistent improvement. \\n\\nWillard Park offers park benches under shade trees, an outdoor pool, a large picnic shelter, a soccer field, and playground equipment that is a source of pride in the neighborhood. There's also a nice trail that goes around the fairly small park - it's easily wheelchair friendly and the sidewalk that surrounds the large parking lot has multiple curb cuts with the pool area being the most obvious point of entry. \\n\\nThe park is right next to a fire station, which adds to the safe feeling that now dominates the park. Additionally, there's the adjacent Sylvia Likens Memorial donated by the late Indiana filmmaker Ivan Rogers that honors the memory of 16-year-old Sylvia Likens, who was murdered in one of Indiana's most tragic and unforgettable tales. While the sidewalk does not go up to the memorial, the ground is fairly even and even being in a wheelchair myself I've never had difficulty reaching it. \\n\\nWillard Park isn't Indy's most extravagant park. It doesn't offer all the luxuries. While there's a crosswalk from the neighborhood to the park across what can be a busy East Washington Street, I do wish the neighborhood park felt more accessible to the neighborhood. However, it's a beautiful park made more beautiful by recent upgrades and practically defines what it means to be a neighborhood park. \\n\\nI remember living in the area and making jokes about Willard Park. There's nothing to joke about now - it's a little gem in a little gem of a neighborhood.\",\n",

I've tried calling the mayor's action line, but will not be able to get through until Monday. Just wanted to let everyone know so you can make an informed decision before going to that pool. P.S. I assume the city is handling all the Indy Parks pools in this manner.\",\n",

There is a free private lot, a playground, a walking/running trail, a full basketball court, a half basket court, and an aquatic center.

There is a long ram that leads up to the top of the jungle gym equipment.  It is some older looking equipment that could use some TLC. Kids will still find it entertaining. The pavilion is massive and has picnic tables. The basketball courts are nice for the most part. The full court has a few cracks, tons of trash, some graffiti. It needs a resurfacing.  The half court was a bit lower than the standard height (not complaining) and was in better shape than the full court. It also has 2 4-square courts on the end opposite the hoop.\\n\\nThe trail is unpaved but pretty wide. Not sure how far it is, but it looked like a quarter to a half mile or so.\\n\\nThe park has a lot of space. It spans over 11 acres. It also has lots of trash. I even saw a spot where someone dumped burned charcoal from their grill. There was a city worker there picking up trash when I was there, but they needed a team to tackle that job.\\n\\nThe park has a memorial for Sylvia Likens in the back near the fence, a young girl that was tortured and murdered by her caregiver.\\n\\nThis is a decent park, even though it is slipping a bit.  It has lots of potential and can easily be a five star spot.',\n",

Some braids looked atrocious. Secondly, they must have a)pulled my edges too tight or b) braided them carelessly but my edges are still recovering from this those braids and I took them out a month ago. A few of the edge braids fell out (with my hair) and multiple were on their last life, so by the time I took them out, the ones on their last life ended up ripping out my hair. So, I need to hold off getting braids for a while because my edges need to recover definitely. Certainly will not be returning here.\",\n",

Another woman joined her (Aicha?) and she finished my hair. Neither women raked my thick, kinky hair with a fine tooth comb, like some shops.\\n\\nI got waist-length medium-sizes Senegalese Twists, using Xpression brand hair. I am very satisfied.

I too researched for months, read reviews before excitingly making my appointment for this salon. I even armed myself with pictures of the style I wanted. My goal was to have bigger sections with less braids and no bulk.\\n\\nI arrive to my appointment less than 10 min late because I came from NJ. Thank Google for GPS!! I walked in the salon with my hair and was greeted. In looking around perhaps I was expecting something else because I walked out pretending i left something in my car to make sure I was at the right place. I was. There didn\\'t seem to be enough braiders, but I thought that more would come. I sat there over an hour waiting for my \"appointment\" to get started. Finally I am summoned over to the chair. \"The owner\" asks me what I want. I tell her box braids. She says $160, but since I booked my appointment online it was $150. As instructed by the sign, I gave her my money before the service started. Later I see it was not always the case. The price includes the hair, but I brought my own. There should be some consideration made for that, just a suggestion. One that was not appreciated, based on her private emailed reply. Also, update the website to indicate the hair is included.\\n\\nI show the braider my pictures, she asked the owner questions in their native tongue. I showed the pictures to the owner. Then gave specific instructions, but I guess I held the only mirror they had too long, because the owner grabs it and tells the braider to get started. Her attitude and  demeanor was that of a dictator. She didn\\'t care what I wanted, was only concerned with quantity instead of complying with the wish of a paying customer. My braider was working on two people at a time. She would start a section of braids on one head going half way down, then go to the next. Another girl would finish the braid. During the process I wanted to walk out because I felt like my wishes were not being honored, but I already gave the owner my money. Nothing in her attitude made me feel I could approach or discuss any complaints. This is further confirmed by the emails I received from her calling me dishonest in my Google review.

I cut a few inches off because they were too long. To shower I have to make two thick messy buns.  For sleeping i have to drape them. Just a really sad experience.

There is also nature hiking (dogs on leash) and a 1/2 mile paved trail if you prefer than the dog park. The people and dogs are very friendly. If you want bring lunch since they have picnic tables to enjoy being outside, since its a nice tranquil place. \\n\\n\\nThe only slight negative remark is there aren\\'t many signs directing you to areas such as the \"beach\" / pond-area where the dogs can enjoy some refreshing time. Thank goodness for the kindness of people to help direct and inform you. \\n\\nSome suggestions bring water for your dog, bug repellent for yourself and energy. \\nThis is definitely a place I\\'ll be returning even though it\\'s a 90 minute drive. \\nIT IS WORTH VERY MILE!!',\n",

The wooded paths are too great a temptation for the large breeds and they're more interested in further exploration than intimidating my little guy. Plenty of other toys were also enjoying themselves. \\n\\nThis is a walking dog park, not a large pen. It's meant to give you both exercise and is a lovely concept and execution. There are wide paths, as well as narrow paths, and while I could tell there were many dogs there at the same time, I never felt like anyone was running over top of us and we were alone most of our walk. \\n\\nBeautiful park. The fence is at least six feet high (perhaps higher?) so no worries about your dog jumping it. Well worth a little road trip if you aren't from the area.\\n\\nBring water for your pet.

I've been here about a dozen times at this point, and only have met 1-2 aggressive dogs with jerkwad owners. Easy enough to leash him and go in the other direction. \\n\\nMy only complaints is that some people don't pick up after their dogs outside of the fenced in area, and that poison ivy is sometimes spotted inside and outside the park. I simply tell my dog to avoid that area and he listens, because I've gotten some nasty rashes before petting him after he's been through some brush.

However I did see someone with a very small child inside the dog park itself. I don't recommend that! \\n\\nI suppose the park could be better with a big flat open area, or some kind of amenities. A smaller dog park for little dogs or small pups maybe. Someone else mentioned that it could use an enclosed flat area to play frisbee or fetch, and I definitely agree with that.

Don't get me wrong, if you have trained your dog to listen to you very well I couldn't care less if you let them roam off-leash, but this is not the case for many. As you can imagine, it makes my girl pretty nervous when she's on-leash with nowhere to go and a dog comes sprinting up to her. Sometimes there's even a crowd of rowdy dogs blocking the entrance/exit to the concrete path. I really really love all dogs, but at the end of the day, it's a recipe for disaster if you let your dog run up to every random person/dog/child.

I genuinely love this place and will miss it when I leave this area. If you have a pet or just want to walk through the woods, Camden County has preserved a beautiful place for that to happen.\",\n",
       " 'I love this dog park. They have a great enclosed dog run with lots of side paths and plenty of space for the dogs to run around. If you go to the other side of the dog run and walk half a mile down the path you get to a lovely pond for the dogs to go swimming in. I would have given it 5 stars but there are lots of ticks and no running water in the park for give dogs. For the most part, the dogs are friendly and the owners attentive.',\n",
       " 'I went there today for the first time. On my way home. I smelled dog shit. Dog owners that leave their dog shit on trails with leaves covering it are idiots. All over my boots. Will never return. It was not as good as I thought it would be.',\n",

And it wasn\\'t the first time I\\'ve seen it.\\nMy pup ran by the little girl and must have bumped her or something and she starts saying \"he bit me.\" Absolutely wouldn\\'t happen. I kind of freaked and told the dad he shouldn\\'t have those kids walking around like that in a dog park and we took off. It really upset my wife, so she isn\\'t a fan of going back. The last thing in the world you need is some little girl telling people your dog bit her. Take your kids to the freakin\\' playground.\\n\\nAside from that, it is a really nice place.',\n",
       " 'Oh my god, what a find. I had read really good things about this park but was waiting for the weather to turn warmer before I could bring my new puppy here. We came here on a Sunday when it was 60 and sunny. The parking lot was filled with families with dogs. A short walk took us to the fenced in area of the dog park and my dog was in literal heaven. He got so much place  to run and jump around. All the doggies and dog parents were very friendly. A short hike took us to the pond where the pups can try swimming. My puppy absolutely loved the pond and he loved running around the park. He has been one tired pup for rest of the evening.\\n\\nWe will definitely be coming here a lot more often in summers..',\n",

There's also a lake which the dogs can go in too which is awesome for when it's warm out. My dog is 8months old and about 92 lbs and I've seen dogs as big as 120 lbs as well as dogs under 10lbs and all dogs seem to get along great! There's water bowls as well as gallons of water for when the pups get thirsty. This place was absolutely the best dog park we've ever been to and will continue going to.\",\n",
       " \"The most amazing dog park ever! I was so scared to let my dog go into the 7 acres fenced in wooded area but everyone there reassured me he would be fine.

I can't  wait  to visit again and again!\",\n",

After many hikes with my dog in other parks where he has always been on the leash, my goofy mutt was so confused when he was able to venture wherever or do whatever he wanted in this park.\\n\\nIn the city, a lot of dog parks have hoses for giving the dogs water to drink while playing around, but luckily this place has a cool bottle recycling program where dog parents bring and refill gallons of water like a cute little community.  Every person and dog that I interacted with was really friendly, and I can't wait to come back many more times when we move back to South Jersey.\\n\\nI highly recommend coming here if you and your dog are looking for fun in Camden County!\",\n",

I get annoyed every visit though because people obviously do not read the rules that are posted as soon as you enter or care to obey them, especially the NO CHILDREN UNDER 12 rule.  It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible of parents to bring their children into the gated section of the off-leash DOG PARK.  It is supposed to be a safe place for dogs to run around and freely play and it really ruins it when you have to worry about your dog accidentally hurting a little child!',\n",

They love the freedom of being able to run around off leash and I love that they're fenced in and I can always find them if I need them. We have never run into shady characters as one review said. Also this isn't the park I bring them to throw balls any way. My 2 23 lbs terrier mixes love being able to roam free. I've met so many nice people and dogs here. I really can't say enough nice things about this park. Yes not everyone cleans up after their dog but that doesn't take away from the fact that this park is awesome.

LOL!\\n\\nThe reason I love this dog park is because everyone has to keep moving!  Unlike your typical dog park, Timber Creek is not just an open field with a fence around it. The 9 acre off-leash dog park includes a large wooded area surrounded by a wide walking path, all *inside* a fence.  So, while the owners are walking the path, the dogs run/walk alongside us while darting in and out of the woods, chasing critters and birds.  \\n\\nThere are additional trails in Timber Creek outside of the dog park.  More stuff at the park: a lake, playground with fun equipment for kids, a large grassy field with a walking track, lots of parking, restrooms, picnic areas, outdoor amphitheater, and some additional grassy areas where the community, the township and dog rescues/shelters hold events all year round. \\n\\nThere really is something for everyone here.\",\n",

       " \"Had my first experience at Timber Creek Park this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised!  I was a little nervous to let my dog, Molly, off leash because she's not exactly an off leash dog. However, I felt more secure about it when I saw all of the other dogs that were running around without their leashes on. (I also have a tile on Mollys collar, which would have been useful If I had difficulty finding her)\\n\\nTCP has three different entrances, the main one is up the steps from the parking lot. The entrances are all double gated- which I love, so you have to use two gates for entering and exiting which prevents runaways!\\n\\nThe enclosed-in area is huge, you can't see the entire park from any angle because there are so many trees. Molly had a blast at TCP and surprisingly did really well off-leash!! My parents have a huge backyard that she loves to play in, but this was great because this was more of a wooded environment. There are no separate areas for big or little dogs, so they are all mixed together which might be concerning for some little dog owners, but I saw plenty of little dogs doing great off leash. \\n\\nThere were also a few water bowls out, and a water fountain near the entrance.\",\n",

I figured out later as we were walking on the trails exploring that there was a cross country meet happening, which is why it was more crowded than usual. But anyways... wasn't sure which way to go to the dog park.. we just followed the other dogs and they lead us to the entrance! From the lot, go towards the right trails and you'll find yourself on the right path to the dog park or do what we did and just follow all the other doggies!\\n\\nYou'll see a fence with the dog park rules. Double fenced to prevent any doggies from escaping which is good. And then unleash your doggy and just have a great time! The park is large enough to have your doggy run around and just feel free. My dog Chewy really enjoyed.. although he was more interested in chasing the squirrels haha. We had just moved from Hawaii and we have no squirrels there. He did have fun with a few other dogs tho. Keep in mind that if it just rained a day or 2 before, it will probably be muddy so bring a towel to wipe off your furball!\\n\\nWill definitely be coming back!\",\n",

At first I was nervous to unleash, but soon found the dogs and owners pleasant and friendly. My dog was afraid at first but soon was running with the rest! I brought him there to socialize and that's what we got.  The park is fenced, wooded and quite big! Several wide and clear paths for walking, some hills and yes, stumps and roots so just watch where you walk. I saw no poo on the path and if you forget a bag, there are quite a few tied to the fence along the way and there are trash cans for the poo bags, so don't fling them over the fence!

One has nothing to do with reviewing the park and the other is from someone who thinks she can tell if her dog is bored. Huh?  Can you also tell if an egg is happy?  What did your dog do to indicate that it was bored?  Sit on a log, cross it\\'s legs and light a cigarette?  And there\\'s nowhere to let your dog tear out?  Seriously?  Listen sweetie, just because the path has turns in it does not mean your dog can\\'t run at full speed for as long as it wants. \\n\\nThe hubster and I took our pup to Timber Creek yesterday and all three of us had a blast!  There is AMPLE space to throw a ball (you simply have to take a ball with you, pick it up and throw it!) and the other dogs and owners at the park were great. It was our first outing to a dog park and we were ill-prepared for the day out. Other owners were so quick to offer our dog water when the only water we had was in our car. Next time we\\'ll know to take a back pack with bottles of water and a bowl. \\n\\nI\\'m sure that Timber Creek, like every other dog park, will have some jerk-wad bring a dog that is aggressive. Read reviews of every other dog park and you\\'ll read the same story about an aggressive dog. That\\'s not the park\\'s fault, that\\'s the dog owners fault.  I saw no sign at Timber Creek that read, \"Aggressive dogs are welcome here.\"  Give your one-star review of the dog owner, not of the park. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a great place to let your dog run free, look no further.',\n",

       " 'Got my dog spayed here and had the WORST experience.  I wish I could put 0 stars.\\nWe had previously seen Dr.Muzyka and she seemed quite nice-- although whenever she gave my dog shots she would distract her with a cookie even though we said she\\'s quite car sick and even she advised us that having an empty stomach would be better. The first time she threw up on the way back from the vet\\'s my husband and I were pretty worried, so we called telling them she just got a vaccine and is throwing up more than usual in the car. They said \"oh we forgot to tell you it can cause nausea as a side effect. Call us again if she continues throwing up after an hour.\" THEY FORGOT?!\\nAnyway, about the spay, we were to drop the dog off and come back after a few hours. No over night stay. \\nWe get there and we can actually hear her crying... a tech at the front desk assures me that she\\'s been quiet all day except for now. When we finally got her and proceeded to pay - and sign our souls away- the same tech asks \"do you want an e-collar?\" YOU\\'RE ASKING ME? YES I WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO JUST RIP OUT HER STITCHES. We got an e-collar that we had to put on ourself, at home, because she \"didn\\'t want to upset her more\". We were sent home with only 4 syringes that were to be taken once daily. That\\'s all. Basically like 1 puppy Tylenol after having SURGERY. \\nShe was in so much pain that evening she couldn\\'t lay down. Her feet would start to splay out and start to slide out from under her because she was so exhausted from standing from the pain. In the morning she tried to lay down but every time she would scream out in pain, not just a whine or yelp. We took her to an emergency animal hospital where they said her suture technique caused a lot of puckering, it was so swollen we couldn\\'t see the stitches and thought it had popped. They gave us anti-inflammatory and extra pain medication and she seemed to be much better with those. Time passed and one stitch just wasn\\'t dissolving? Back to the hospital to get it clipped.\\nNOW her tummy is speckled and there is a nub which is bothering her and a crazy swollen infection  which is causing us to miss work and take her in AGAIN. It\\'s been 1 month and 3 weeks since her operation, she should be peachy dandy by now. My biggest fear is that if they can mess up her stitches so badly and not feel they need to give meds or a collar; what is her inside like? What did they mess up there which is causing so many problems?! \\nPlease don\\'t chalk it up to us being negligent puppy parents; we followed every step of advice (and more since we purchased the e-collar). I slept in her kennel area with her the night of her operation. My husband missed multiple days of work in which he gets paid a day rate,  not hourly, so he missed those days and didn\\'t get paid. I am part time (only gone on Wed, Fri, and Sat) and missed extra days as well just to be with her and monitor. \\nI\\'m absolutely horrified with the Ottwell Animal Clinic and their service. How dare you.',\n",

The last few times we saw a new vet there and she didn't even look at my dog, didn't touch him and the appointment which I paid $120 for lasted about 3 minutes.  She was very disinterested and didn't seem to care at all just wrote a prescription and sent us on our way.  I have decided to look for a new clinic.\",\n",

First off, I loved the design of the salon: very modern and trendy, so I was comfortable with that. Normally, I am skeptical with trying new salons/stylists, but Tabby did such a great job with my hair! I have had problems with other stylists not being able to achieve the look that I want, but Tabby was great! She's so sweet and she knew exactly the look I was going for.

She is so much fun and keeps up with all the latest trends, does hair shows, and really knows her stuff! \\n\\nThis salon is beautiful, and there's a lot of windows so natural light makes it a great experience! The view of downtown is great too! I was offered a water/tea/coffee when I arrived which was as nice touch. \\n\\nI'm very pleased with my hair since Belinda gave me a ton of options since I wasn't sure what I really wanted to do.

I get that they\\'re trying to create a certain atmosphere, but as a guy, there\\'s a limit to how much atmosphere I need when I\\'m getting my hair cut.\\n\\nOne aspect of this that really chaps me is the desire to be \"exclusive,\" meaning that every so often they seem to drop product lines if someone else starts carrying them.  This means that, as a customer, if I become used to using a product, my stylist can no longer use the product or get the product for me and I have to find it elsewhere, or else switch to another one that they carry.  This sucks for me, obviously, but also sucks for my stylist because it prevents them from providing a reliable and consistent customer experience.  And consider I just spent $20 on product at another salon because I can no longer get the (locally-made) Kenra line there.  \\n\\nThis exclusivity may ultimately come at a cost to some of your less-well-situated customers who have to justify the expense of all this atmosphere.',\n",

He squeezed me in, not only to correct my box color debacle, but also to get my hair done for my wedding on short notice.

I went in with highlights over my natural color and was looking for something to freshen things up.  I explained that my goal was to get back to my natural shade with less highlights.  I came out 200 dollars later with multi dimensional color masking all natural color in shades that I have never experienced.  My cut was beautiful but the color was not what I was looking for at all.  I think the words \"natural\" and \"my natural color\" were dismissed in a big way.  I called back 2 weeks later (as I had been out of town the first week) explaining that the color at the crown was very unnatural for me and again expressed my desire to get closer to my natural.  200 dollars is alot to spend on hair you don\\'t love nor even like.  Another 2.5 hours in the chair and I walked out with Chunky highlights.  It looks better...but still not at all what I was asking for.  Nor was I looking for an additional 35 dollar charge for this.  I spoke with the manager the following day explaining why I wouldn\\'t be back to his salon and I was told that they very seldom have clients come in for all over base color with some highlights and what I asked for was not their \"norm\" and they are basically a \"what\\'s in\" salon.  I find this to be a very sad statemen.  I have a very hard time believing they have never heard any of my complaints before.  Regardless, the facility is beautiful on the inside and the my cut was exactly what I was looking for but there is arrogance in this overpriced salon.  I will also warn that any fees are not discussed until after the service is finished.  I asked when the stylist started during the first round and was estimated about 40 less than what the bill ended up being.  Not going to lie but I was shocked.  The extra 35 dollars was never explained either as I was there for a re-do of color I didn\\'t like.  The stylist told me AFTER she was finished that she had spoken to the manager and they came up with that fee.  Umm, no one discussed it with me??  235 dollars later and I\\'m about as far away from my goal as I can get.',\n",

Belinda is knowledgeable about different hair types, textures, and cuts.

       " \"I recently went into MDG salon on April 4th to get my hair done by Tiffany. I showed her a picture of what i wanted which was pretty blonde and looked like a balayage. I had medium/dark hair when i came in and i know i wouldn't be as blonde as the picture i showed her but i knew i could at least be a few shades lighter and more solid. we had a consultation and since she was the professional i took her advice on what we should do. she told me baby lights and a malibu treatment (which was $35 and did absolutely nothing.)would be the best way to get my hair going towards what wanted. also my natural hair is pretty blonde and was about three inches grown out so i had a pretty solid line from the grow out and the permanent dye i had. so i was hoping to be able to get rid of that line, instead Tiffany took the highlights up to my roots that were already blonde so it made it even lighter and the line worse. The highlights were so fine that the dark didn't even look much different than what i came in with and the banding around my head was still there. it looked so bad and i had streaky highlights when it should've been more solid for $360! she seemed in a rush the entire time. also i was charged extra for the toner which i wasn't informed about. so the next day i called back and asked for a redo and when i got there and told her what was wrong she acted like it looked perfectly fine and wasnt even taking in consideration on what i wanted. she ended up only balayaging the front and doing a couple pieces in the back. looks better than before but still nothing close to what i originally wanted and still have so much dark left over. honestly it was just a disappointment especially for paying so much for something i didn't ask for. i will leave the pictures of what i asked for and what i had gotten below. $360 i could've spent somewhere else for a way better job.\",\n",

She explains exactly what she is doing and why so you can follow along every step with her. Lauren is also upfront and honest about what will and won't work with your hair.

I left with my hair being the exact same brown color with charcoal tones for $70 + tip. We did the first round of color and it was too light, the ends were almost translucent looking. So she suggested going one shade darker and when I saw myself in the mirror, after rinsing the color out, my heart sank. \"WHERE DID THE GRAY GO??\", was my first thought. I expressed how frustrating the situation was and how disappointed I was to have damaged my hair so much for such a lackluster result. I got $10 off and the option to come back two weeks later and pay $100+ to have it redone. Are you kidding me?! I kept the appointment anyway thinking we could add lighter highlights to give it dimension. After deciding that I could do a better job at home I told her I needed to cancel the appt. I said I would love for her to maintain it after I find the right shade (as she\\'s super personable and friendly). I also asked advice for who she would recommend to cut my hair there. No reply! Never heard from her again. Not only does it damage her own reputation it causes a loss of business for the salon.

The edge up is supposed to naturally go with your hair line. The first barber pushed it back way too far and the 2nd one didn\\'t do as bad but still noticeably did the same thing. I like a natural look, not sharp lines. And I made it a point to tell the barber this and he still did it. So, I don\\'t know what to say.

They have a train section that makes me want to build an entire town and travel through it on Thomas the tank engine. As the mother of an eleven month old I also love the easy in store entrance into babies R us which is a wonderful albeit expensive place. So of course being a toy store they have an amayzing selection but they are very pricey. A toy that is five dollars at Kohl's is thirteen dollars here.\",\n",

Not to mention they always have some sort of good special running on Lego's that you cannot find anywhere else. Right now if you buy a Lego Construction set thats valued over $30.00 you can get a free Ninjago Copter! How cool is that! Relive your childhood engage in freedom, and become one with the toy!\",\n",

Knowing this, My daughter and I woke up at 3:30AM to drop my husband off at work using our only car and then headed home until it was closer to opening time. I pulled into the parking lot of this location at about 7:30, and to my surprise there was no line outside like I had expected. I grabbed my daughter and hurried inside to find out that all the consoles had been sold. Now, my issue isn't that the consoles ended up selling out. I figured it was a 50/50 chance that I would get one. My issue is with the location opening long before it's announced opening time. Had I known the store would've opened earlier, I would've been there earlier. If the store is going to open at 8AM, then open it at 8AM. I wouldn't have been so compelled to write a review if I had been there at 8AM waiting in line and the consoles sold before I could grab one. At least the store would've been holding true to its announced opening time.\",\n",

The service goes in and out so I would recommend you have the directions saved just to be safe.

At first I was worried that having a tour guide would've made it less fun, but honestly, Nick enhanced our experience through some of the stories he told us on our few small breaks. \\n\\nThis overall experience was super fun! I highly recommend Enjoy The Mountain for anyone who wants a real adventure!\\n\\nJust a few tips:\\n1. Sign your waivers ahead of time! The reception up there is spotty, and you'll  waste lots of time waiting to get enough signal to access the waivers online.\\n2. Take screenshots of confirmation email they send you when you finish the waiver. That way when you arrive, you won't be trying to load your email with the half bar of reception you get.\\n3. Plan to arrive 30min - 1 hour early. The path there is kind of tricky, and it's very easy to take the wrong turn and waste time. Follow the directions they send to your email. \\n4.

I was a little worried that the people might not show because it seemed like a small website and company, but there were no issues with timing at all. \\n\\nOverall, it was a pretty fun experience! Our guide was already there when we arrived, taking another group of people out on the mountain. He was professional and helpful, but it would have been nice to get off the ATVs for a few minutes near the top to get some nice views of the valleys below. He was more than happy to take pictures for us, and he definitely seemed to know his way around the trails in Santa Barbara.\\n\\nThe ATVs that we used were pretty new, and we didn't have any mechanical issues at all. They were a little muddy from the previous group that went out, but it wasn't anything too bad. You have the option of getting a single person ATV, or having 2 riders on 1 ATV. If you really don't want to be in charge of driving, I guess you could book the double occupant ATV, but if you're going to go, you might as well drive on your own right? All their ATVs are automatic, so it's literally just a gas and go type of deal. Super easy to use. If you can ride a tricycle, you can ride an ATV. \\n\\nAfter booking the trip online, I got a lot of information on when and where to meet via email. The company does a good job of giving you that information before your trip. A little on the expensive side if you ask me, but if you're looking for a fun little activity to do in the area, I would recommend these guys!\",\n",

Best decision ever! Although getting to the meeting point was a bit scary as we drove 15 mph through winding roads next to steep cliffs, the views were nice and the ATV experience was totally worth it! We gave ourselves plenty of time to get lost and it took us about 1.5 hours to get to the checkpoint. Luckily Google Maps was on the entire time and we even had an hour to kill on top of the mountain before our 12:30pm appointment. (Also had screenshots of the directions in case we lost service).\\n\\nUpon arrival, we met with the two girls who were wearing face masks and face shields so we felt safe. They had all the sanitizing stuff. They checked us all in, gave us each a mesh covering for our head, pairs of gloves, goggles and helmets. They offered different insurance plans (just like a rental car company), each ranging in price. Then, they walked us over to the ATVs where Jorge was our tour guide. He asked us if we've ever rode before and taught us how to use the automatic ATVs and made us feel comfortable and safe. (Throttle was on the right handle bar and brakes on the left. Second brake was a foot pedal). We drove on wide and narrow trails, over some fun rocky areas, kicking up lots of dust, and he took photos of us the entire time. This was a great family bonding experience and we're all still talking about how fun it was and want to do it again. \\n\\nKnow Before You Go: It gets dusty so wear clothes and closed toe shoes that you're ok getting dirty. Give yourself plenty of time to drive to the location because the last thing you want to do is rush through the scary mountain roads.\\n\\n10/10 would definitely do this again!\",\n",

Also, if you are afraid of heights or get motion sickness this is not the place for you. If you will be riding for long take a backpack for water etc. The location is a bit tough to find so make sure to allow yourself enough time for travel. Happy trails! :-)\",\n",

The views don't last too long because then you have to get back to the starting point due to renting out hourly periods. The worst part for me was the crazy drive just to get to the Meet Location.

It's a mountain and the road is narrow so you have to plan for driving slower going up. We stayed in Solvang and it took us a little over an hour to get there. \\n\\nWe did the beginners ride for 2 hours and it was very fun. Our guide, Jorge, was excellent. He gave us clear directions on how to operate the ATVs and took us up the trail and helped us when we got to narrow paths.

It\\'s been several months and I\\'ve been meaning to write a review, however with the Pandemic (and extra shifts in the medical ICU), I haven\\'t had a chance. Anyways, a few months back I walked in to get the 21 K engagement gold for my fiancÃ© (now wife- who happens to be Palestinian-American). The encounter with the sales rep started friendly however after hearing what I was buying and where my wife was from, he became aggressive. He repeatedly asked me again and again where my wife was from as he did not know where \"Palestine\" was and instead kept referring to my wife\\'s birth place as Israel. His quote directly was \"I don\\'t know where that place is but I know where Israel is...\" with an ugly grin. Knowing the struggle Palestinians have been going through, and his cockiness and attitude, really disappointed me in what was to be a joyous occasion. I just left the place given this mistreatment. As a white male- especially as a physician at Jefferson at the time- I don\\'t normally experience racism that much, especially not in a racially diverse center in Center city.

First off, my technician is a perfectionist. Didn\\'t get her name because I forgot but I def won\\'t forget her face and talent. I got a fill and repair and I feel like I got a whole new set (but not for the price of one ) my coffin shape is beautiful, absolutely structured perfectly and man are they built nicely. Not too much acrylic nor gel polish on top. She even used a nail form to fix one of my nails because it was curving so bad, like I said she\\'s a perfectionist. She didn\\'t have to do that but she went ahead and made them even more outstanding. Secondly, as soon as you walk in your greeted promptly. They sat me down within 5 mins and I had a 3pm appt and walked in at about 3pm lol. Their selection of gel colors and dipping powders was overwhelming - but in a good way!! They just had so many colors, glitters and everything. You walk in with one idea but end up seeing all the things they have and end up wanting something else!!! Overall such a good experience, prime technician and beyond excellent work and talent. Like my tech said \"there\\'s no limit\" because literally, they have it all! If I could give it more than 5 stars I really wish I could!! 10/10 highly recommend. Pricing wise, it\\'s up there but it\\'s affordable.

We were on a mission to find the best salon for nails, mission is over!\\nHave to say out of all the places we have tried this one is the superior on customer service, friendly-ness, & knowledgeability, they are able to do higher end services. \\nWe made an appointment as they were pretty busy and got in right on time. \\nThey specialize in the basics as well as more complicated designs and more exotic pedicures. We both tried the jelly pedicure and it was soo soothing plus I love the way the jelly feels it gets thicker it's soo therapeutic. My ankles were swollen and hurting afterwards my feet felt brand new, plus they take their time, nothing turns me off more than when you pay for a higher priced  service and they try to rush you out the door so that they can get more quantity of customers instead of focusing on the quality of their services. I certainly don't repeat places that do that and it's far more common than not. \\nNow for the nail services, my daughter did tips with powder color and the finished result was beautiful she also had a crystal design on one fingernail expertly done & fast.\\nI personally love the powder dip the best, it NEVER fades or chips or peels off like regular polish and the gel does and I have it over my real nails, the powder makes them stronger as well, I  have never had a broken nail and my real nails got soo long I had to trim them 1/2 inch. \\nSo I'd say if you want to end the nail tips with gel service get the powder over your real nails and watch how quickly they grow in a month you will no longer need nail tips! Or in the very least try tips with powder color you won't regret it.\\nThe selection of colors are beautiful and like I said it never fades, plus it takes half the time.\\nI hadn't been to get my nails done in awhile so my old nails from my last salon visit grew out my daughter noticed how vibrant the powder color was, still after two months that she ended up doing the powder as she could not believe how fresh looking my color looked even after all that time between salon services, we will definitely return and this will be the place of preference that we will frequent for now on. \\nThere's nail salons on every corner literally but finding one that actually knows what they're doing and has real expertise is rare, this place is a gem and I highly recommend them.\",\n",

Technically, I only have to get them re-done because my nails have grown out but they still look better then they have anywhere else after a week or 2. Plus, the attention to detail and nail art is EXCELLENT. \\n\\nEven with having short/bitten nails originally, the acrylic nor other product they use have lifted. They are a little pricier but you get what you pay for. To me, it's well worth it for quality work.\\n\\nSide note: I don't even normally write reviews.\",\n",

We made an appointment as they were pretty busy and got in on time. \\nThey specialize in the basics as well as designs. \\nI personally love the powder dip, it is the absolute the best, it NEVER fades or chips and I have it over my real nails and the powder makes them stronger. I have never had a broken or chipped nail, my real nails got soo long I had to trim them 1/2 inch. So I'd say if you want to end the nail tip with gel service get the powder over your real nails and watch how quickly they grow in a month you will no longer need nail tips! The colors are beautiful and like I said never fades, plus it takes half the time.\",\n",

I was assured that's what they specialize in, imagine my surprise when it comes time to soak them off that I realize they had used MMA acrylic. Not only did they charge me prices that would have justified regular acrylic, they clearly don't inform their clientele about using crappy products on natural nails that could lead to damage. It took me a full 3 hours of soaking and scraping to get the gummy, sticky and smelly MMA off. I would not recommend using this place and if you still want to, save you nails and bring your own product in. My nails overall had varying thickness, cuticles weren't cleaned properly, lengths of the nails were off too. The tech filed over my cuticles a couple of times, which was quite painful.\",\n",

The shop was clean enough with modern/stylish decor\\n2. The customer service was on point. My mom and I walked in (no appointment) around noon on a Monday. We were immediately greeted and given a wait estimate (30 min) that was surprisingly accurate. \\n3. The lady who did our pedicures (sorry, didn't catch her name) was very sweet, took her time, and asked clarifying questions (bonus) \\n4. The nail tech who did my dip powder (also, didn't get her name, but she was at station #8) was so sweet omg, and she did a GREAT job shaping my little stubs . She went out of her way to find matching gel color for my toes and gave advice on how long it would take for my nails to grow out to the length needed for the shape I want. \\n\\nOpportunities: \\n1. I think added a nice playlist or playing something on the TV for guests waiting would add a nice touch to the ambiance of the place. \\n2. They have an extensive # of nail colors and I love how they have them organized into books for color selection, one thing I'd suggest is pairing the powder/gel colors with matching gel/regular color options. \\n3. This is very small, but I have to add that the water pressure in the toilet in the bathroom was weak AF. I just feel like that's a disaster waiting g to happen so, if it's an easy fix, I'd get that together as well. \\n\\nOverall, I think they are running a very nice establishment here.

I called the evening before trying to get an appt. with with Rosie or Ly but unfortunately they were had no exact available time that I needed. Understandable I did call the day before. She said over the phone that I didn't need an appt to just come because ANYONE who worked there would be able to do what I wanted which was a small nail extension with a gel manicure. Well I showed up around 10:15 am to give the time to settle because they open around 9:30 am. There was only 1 person ahead of me when I arrived & was getting a pedicure/nail Fill. After me 3 other people had a walk-in as well! Ly had already ask me 2x what was I there to get. So I told her once again what I wanted. They attended 2 other walk-ins before me. Still I said nothing! Then another 4 walk in case in & they told the new walk in that it would be a 30 mins wait. Mind you at this point I was already waiting 1hr 10 min still for someone to take care of me & NOTHING. I was so upset, I didn't want to say anything but just be patient & hopefully get some acknowledgement. They didn't acknowledge nor apologize for me waiting so long. So after 20 min later of still waiting & NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. I put there nail color option book back & told them thank you but no thank you I'm leaving. I'm not one those people that complains about BS but I needed them to realize that just because I wasn't going to spend $90-$100 on my nails doesn't mean I'm less important!

Again I felt that he didn't pass judgement when discussing my playing (or lack of) habits. \\nI hit a few dozen balls in the simulator with each variation, until we found one that felt good all around based on the weight of the shaft, lie angle and stiffness. We spent a good amount of time on the weight and stiffness of the shaft. When it came to the flex of the shaft we were right on the border of regular and stiff, but when I mentioned previously liking the feeling of hitting a friend's stiff shaft driver, he went and got some new shafts to try and we found the perfect one out of this new group (stiff). \\nOverall it was a great experience and I would recommend coming here for the fitting. Thanks to Billy for actually listening to my concerns and being professional and friendly during the process. \\nThe store in general had a great selection, competitive pricing and the front-end staff were friendly as well. In total I spent about 2 hours in the store also trying different drivers and putters and never felt rushed or pressured. I'm looking forward to getting my new clubs.\",\n",
       " \"Awesome place.  Enormous selections of clubs/equipment.  I spent 4 hours here on a Sunday afternoon hitting drivers and trying out putters.  After hitting 14 different drivers and about 140+ golf balls, I knew I made the right purchase for my new driver.  I would give this place 5 stars, but it seemed that the golf pros and other patrons were a little annoyed that I hogged the golf simulator.  I also didn't get too much help for the pros there, so I had to take upon myself to have a comprehensive testing for the equipment for me to make an informed decision.\",\n",

They do custom fitting and repairs. Every ball you could imagine is for sale at this place as well as nearly every iron set, driver, fairway, or hybrid club.\\n\\nOne of the best features for someone like myself is the pre-owned section. There are many times when some person buys something they know nothing about and they bring it back at some point with not a whole lot of abuse. You can capitalize on this if you know what you\\'re looking for and what to expect. They had a 9.5 degree Ping i15 for $185 the other day, which was a beautifully hitting driver and I would\\'ve bought it except I was determined to buy something new that day. They also had some decent used iron sets as well as many clearanced clubs such as the Nike VR TW forged blades, which I felt were magnificent to strike properly and I nearly bought them on the spot.\\n\\nWhen I first entered the store I was somewhat annoyed at the \"how can I help you\" attitude, but later it was nice having five sales people around because if I needed someone to change the settings on the simulator they were available to do that. I got yelled at in the Golf Galaxy in Delaware for doing this even though I\\'m familiar with the equipment. I will never shop at that Golf Galaxy again after seeing this store and experiencing their sales service. They are definitely dedicated to making you happy and are reasonably knowledgeable.\\n\\nThe guy that was helping me with my driver selection put the driver I ended up falling in love with in my hands after watching me hit five balls, though I didn\\'t buy it there (I should have, as I would later find out).\\n\\nThe store also has a tremendous selection of grips, shoes, clothing, bags, putters, and accessories.

I'm sure not all associates are bad, was lucky to find a helpful one last trip after searching. But majority seem there to serve themselves. Very little customer focus or customer engagement.

The prices are good and the staff is very helpful.  \\n\\nThe real reason I\\'m writing this review is to sing the praises of the in house PGA teaching professional, Leigh Taylor.  This is a copy of the thank you letter I sent him....\\n\\n10/13/14\\n\\nDear Leigh,\\n\\nI wanted to thank you for a great lesson.  I finally got to the range on Sunday.  I was doing the penny drill with a regular grip but wasn\\'t having much success with the concept of the left arm pulling.\\n\\nI decided to go with the \"hit down on the ball\" theory.  I took your advice of \"trusting\" the loft of the club to hit the ball into the air and everything changed.  For 20 years I taught myself to scoop the ball off the turf, praying that my swing would bottom out just under the ball.  \\n\\nI was hitting the ball low, in the air and mostly straight.  I also got my regular distances back which had completely disappeared when what little game I had disappeared this summer when I tried to make some changes.  I was even able to hit my 7 wood right off the mat and my go to fairway club, my hybrid 18 degree which I hadn\\'t been hitting in the air much at all this year.  Unfortunately, I wasn\\'t hitting a lot of pennies but I was finally striking the ball and getting it airborne. \\n\\nMy friend Drew and I played The Olde Course at Cobbs Creek today in the rain.  I was digging my 8 iron out of the rough without a problem, going 150 to 160 in the fairway with my 6 iron, and I only had a couple skulls with my irons.  I took some small divots for the first time ever.  Unfortunately I wasn\\'t able to trust the down concept with the hybrid (CHOKE) and retired it in favor of the 6 iron, which with a not so hot tee shot, got me to within 75 yards of the 585 yard hole after two strikes.\\n\\nOverall I didn\\'t score very well, but I did get 3 pars and my first birdie of the year.  My friend who used to be an assistant pro said that it was the best he ever saw me play and I did a lot of things well including putting backspin on chips and short pitches.\\n\\nI knew my driver would suffer a little because for someone of my level it\\'s not a down swing but more of a sweep.  I also knew that the idea of hitting even more down on the wedge, the one club I can hit like a mid handicapper, would result in some really good shots but it would also result in a couple horrible shanks.  The wedge will be quickly corrected I believe.  A shank almost always comes down to slowing the club down and not following through as long as the grip isn\\'t leaving the clubface wide open.\\n\\nI look forward to working with you next spring and really learning how to drive the ball as well as strike the fairway woods and irons.\\n\\nWe both know that I have plenty enough coordination to play this game at a respectable level.  I just need some tweaks and plenty of time at the range.  \\n\\nEveryone hopes that one lesson and a medium bucket of balls will change their game dramatically.  I can honestly say that you have helped me to achieve this.  I had taken 2 lessons in 20 years and I didn\\'t walk away with anything of any significant value.\\n\\nThanks again,\\n\\nLee',\n",
       " '5/11/16\\n\\nI\\'ve been \"playing\" golf on and off since I was 26 and I turn 50 soon. I\\'ve been able to score as low as 39 for nine holes and 90 a couple of times for 18 holes. I\\'ve never been able to drive the ball with any consistency or much distance. Now, after my second lesson with Golf Galaxy, I can say that I can finally drive the ball. I had my lesson with Lee about 8 months ago but never got to the range to apply what I learned.  I hit the first 30 balls with the driver tonight for the most part straight and averaging around 200 yards. \\nThe golf swing is a fairly simple concept. You take the club back on the same plane it starts....with a driver it\\'s around 45 degrees. Normally I would raise the club steep and take it too far back. The 45 degree angle drill with a plow stake got me on plane instantly (never hit it once on the way down) and by doing so it automatically shortened my swing to no more than a 3/4 swing. Many pros say that you can hit the ball pretty much as far with a 3/4 swing as you can by going parallel or past. The first lesson got me to hit down on irons instead of scooping. The second lesson got me to swing on the same 45 degree plane I started on instead of changing the angle to steep as I take the club back, not readjusting and hitting a lot of ground instead of the sweet spot of the driver like I did for the first time tonight. Out of 4 pros I\\'ve worked with in 24 years, Leigh Taylor is the only one who has helped my game.....and fast.',\n",

I asked if they could check my swing speed and the guy at the counter told me to go the the range. I asked if they do it in the shop then he brushed me off and said his fitters were busy. He blew me off so fast I did not get his name. Guy in his late 40s with a beard. \\nDid not ask if I wanted to set up an appointment or offer to assist me in any way.

       " \"Let me begin by saying this is the first gym I've ever belonged to. But it's the first for a reason. Nice location, pretty large, new machines, friendly staff, nice mix of people. I'm very comfortable here and very satisfied.\",\n",
       " \"Back in my hay-day, I was a pretty built dude. I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.\\n\\nAnd then I discovered beer.\\n\\nYears of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. \\n\\nI began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.\\n\\nI've been going 4 times a week ever since. \\n\\nNow, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.\\n\\nThe gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.\\n\\nAside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.\\n\\nWait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.\\n\\nNow, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.\\n\\nSo, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me. I'll be the guy lost in his own reflection in the giant mirrors.\",\n",

In all my years, I've never been greeted by name with a high five and sometimes a conversation.  They've got my schedule down, they know when I'm coming in for the most part, they even know what I'm reading.  And not in a creepy way.  They know I love my spin classes and when I come in they hand me over the red class card immediately because they already know that's where I'm going.  They've even got my keys memorized!\\n\\nI utilized their fitness assessment when I first joined, and I got really worried that I was going to be pressured and ostracized until I bought a personal training package.  Not the case at all.  Tony was super helpful, and had a ton of information, and there was no beef at all when I didn't want to sign up.  He's still friendly, fixes my form if he sees me, and he too also comments on my reading ha.  \\n\\nSpinning Intructor Carl is another amazing staff member.  His classes are energetic, and even though it pisses me off that he'll call me by name to sprint (or call me out on not going fast enough) he challenges me to perform and that pays off.  He's inpsired me to get my own certification that I'm very excited to utilize.\\n\\nThe gym itself gets crowded after work hours, but the parking isn't terrible and there's street parking on Green.  Their hours are great, and they open at 5am during the week...meaning their desk people are there at 4, jeez.  Their equipment is up to date, there are tv's on every machine, they play uplifting music and football on the weekends on the gym TV's.  They have a juice bar with a 4square special, and there's tanning --something that I haven't taken advantage of.  They also have circuit training classes with a trainer at a decent rate, and there's member appreciation events every month.  I mean they REALLY appreciate their members...they give us alcohol!

       " \"I hate working out. No, I HATE HATE HATE working out. I hate breathing hard and sweating and making meaningless motions like picking heavy things up and putting them back down or running in place. It's boring!  Whatevs, I'm an adult and I realize that I should try to stay in shape, especially if I insist on eating like a garbage can.\\n\\nSo I end up at City Fitness 2 or 3 times a week. This is a cheap gym, with no contract requirements and modern equipment. It's a fine place to work out, especially if you are on a tight budget and have a schedule where you can work out during the day. \\n\\nIt's really overcrowded during peak hours. Don't even think about going at 5:30. There is not enough room to stretch, you have to wait for weights and machines, classes are packed past capacity. After 8pm it's much more tolerable. Eh. But seriously, you really can't beat the price, and if I'm going to put myself through something I so despise, I'm glad I can do it for cheap.\",\n",
       " \"Wow- what a disappointment.  Lack of transparency about added costs-- such as a $25 dollar cancellation fee.  Thanks Freddie!  Appreciate you not telling me about that one.  Also there are no managers available to speak to in the hours you would want to speak to them-- as in after 5pm when you are out of work or on the weekends.  It's unfortunate that so many gyms put on these hidden costs-- they make me never want to join gyms.\",\n",
       " \"I recently bought the MetaBody Yoga & Fitness Pass through Groupon which brought me to City Fitness, as it entitled me to 10 spin classes. \\n\\nIf you ever buy this pass, be forewarned that you cannot book these CityFitness classes directly through the MetaBody website as you would with most of the classes. CityFitness sets you up with a one month trial membership. This is awesome because it's not just limited to the spin classes offered on the pass, and you can utilize the gym for any of the services available to a trial membership. \\n\\nMy experience with the trial membership was fairly frustrating. I have a gym in my building so all I really wanted to do was take spin classes. Recently CityFitness switched to an online class sign-up system. I'm sure it's convenient for members but it's not available for anyone with a trial membership. Trial members have to call up the front desk and request to be manually added to the class list. For both members and trial members, each class opens 24 hours in advance. \\n\\nThe sign-up process doesn't seem like a big problem, however I was a huge fan of the 6:30pm Monday spin class with Steve. CityFitness closes at 6PM on Sundays. By the time the gym reopened on Monday morning, the class was typically full.\\n\\nThis speaks very highly to this class and the instructor, Steve. I enjoyed every moment of each class I was able to attend. He is lively, enthusiastic, motivating, friendly, encouraging and just overall fantastic. When my husband and I first started, we took the beginner class where he took the time to teach us proper set-up and technique. Aside from being a great teacher, his music selection was killer. I could only imagine what a bad song set could do to a class, but his music selections were upbeat and perfect for spin. \\n\\nI wasn't thrilled with the spin studio itself. Throughout my experience I personally came across some faulty bikes, from pedal straps that wouldn't tighten to seats that wouldn't adjust. During one class, one classmate was spinning so hard that a pedal broke while he was on the bike. I'm not sure if/when it was fixed but that eliminated one spot in the class for however long it was out of commission. \\n\\nSo long story short: Steve rocked but based on the condition of the studio and the billing issues I've heard about, I will not be buying a membership to CityFitness.\",\n",
       " \"So, I decided that I wanted to try out City Fitness and I figured being a former Ballys member it wouldn't take much to be better! So, I got a 1 week pass to City Fitness and it wasn't bad. I like their cardio equipment because you have your own TV to watch while working out, which is really nice. You can workout an entire hour watching The Devil Wears Prada. \\n\\nIts a nice place to workout and there is plenty of room and help if you need it from the staff. I only wish they had a steam room or hot tub! That could just complete the picture! :) \\n\\nLets hope in their new location when they decide to span out - there is a steam room and a hot tub.\",\n",
       " \"I love City Fitness! They have a wide variety of classes offered and 9/10 teachers I've had have been really good. The only thing I don't love is that the classes are so crowded. Yesterday I arrived to a class and there were so many people taking the class, I didn't have enough equipment to fully participate until someone shared some weights with me (thank you!). They shouldn't overbook the classes if there is only a certain amount of equipment. \\n\\nThere are certain times that are better to go just like any other small(ish) city gym. Early is the morning is much quieter than after work...\\n\\nAlso! The CityPerx program is awesome!! I use it all the time to get discounts around the city. One time I had a problem with a store not accepting the discount, I told Jeff at CF about the issue and he sent me a gift card for the nuisance. As long as I live in the area, I will be a City Fitness member for sure!\",\n",
       " \"Much larger than the new City Fitness on South Street, but also relatively out dated. The cardio room seems smaller than the one on South Street, and the mats provided are a mess. They're really old and overused- they could benefit from an update!\",\n",
       " \"City Fitness : We are good at taking your money - we will bill you months after you cancel. We will bill you for services never rendered. We will give you the run around regarding refunds. You've seen it here before, you need exercise - RUN away from here.\",\n",
       " \"Oh City Fitness...how I used to love you.  You had a fair rate and the billing was never an issue....just don't try and quit this gym.  I cancelled my membership in December and they have still been billing me through March.  When I asked the gentleman at the desk about the policy, he told me I should have been billed for only January, but only the manager can deal with it and he is out until Tuesday.  So basically I'm at the mercy of the Jeff Quinn starting next week.  Has anyone tried to deal with the billing company directly and had any success?  I have zero faith dealing with the gym and most of you have echoed those sentiments....\",\n",
       " \"I was considering signing up, when I phoned to ask if they have a jacuzzi and indoor, heated swimming pool, the man on the phone told me that they do not have either.   He was very rude to me when I explained to him that I wouldn't be signing up because of that.\\n\\nNow I am receiving junk mail from them continually.   I have politely asked them to please stop sending these, they claim they will stop, but they lie.   If I receive just one more, I will knock this review down to one star.\",\n",
       " \"Go to Sweat for a better gym and Planet Fitness for a better deal. Overall this gym was decent while I was a member. However, when equipment was broken it took them at least 10 days to fix it. Watch out for hidden fees and fine print on their contracts. When I tried to cancel my membership I expected an early cancellation fee but the staff at their desk were so unknowledgeable they couldn't actually help me cancel my membership, and I ended up having to pay an extra month on top of the hidden sign up fee, fee to keep your monthly dues locked in, monthly dues etc. Staff were all quick to blame other staff or claim that it wasn't their responsibility which led to being transferred to empty voicemail with no call backs. Stay away!\",\n",
       " 'I agree. \\n\\nI downgraded my contract, which already cost me $40, only to find out month later that it had actually been UPgraded to a 24 month membership. I was certainly not informed of that change during the restructuring of my contract, given that I already knew I was moving 3 month later.  Why in the world would I sign that if I knew about it?\\n\\nIn the end, I signed the contract, so it is ultimately my fault. But it is unacceptable to have a sales rep change my membership in such a drastic way without informing me about it. And now it will cost me $150 to break the contract when I move, which the manager noted, was a huge favor.\\n\\nThis gym is the scum of the world, do not go there.',\n",
       " 'So many fees if u try to quit, plus fees just for the sake of fees while you are a member. Sad stuff.',\n",
       " 'Big gym, equipment is fine. \\nI only give 2 starts for the following reasons..\\n\\nWhen signing up, the guy said if I paid $45.00 a month instead of $35.00 a month, I could cancel at ANY TIME, with no cancelation fee. They STILL tried to charge me a 25$ fee which i had to argue to get taken off. \\n\\nAfter I cancelled my membership and had gotten my last monthly charge of $45.00, i checked my bank statements to see if theyd charge me the cancellation fee, which they didnt, BUT THEY CHARGED ME $39.00 WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE after my third month for NO REASON. I called and they siad its a charge to make sure my monthly fee of $45 never changes.. LOL- charging me money to not charge me MORE money.. The guy signing me up NEVER mentioned this..\\n\\nOne day i went and all of the boxing heavybags had been taken down with no notice.\\n\\nIf you have no other option, go here.. But their scheming ways of making an extra buck off me really pissed me off.',\n",
       " \"Just renewed my membership with Jeff Quinn...great experience. I've been coming here for 3 years (even though I only wrote a review last year, after a year in)..and it's been great. They treat you really well. \\n\\nThe gym has only gotten better, and more extensive with their options since I first started coming..so I'm upgrading my review to 5 stars. They have everything for the serious lifter, the cardio junkie or people who like personal training or classes. Everything. The only things that I would complain about are things they can't control...like parking. Everything else is fantastic.\\n\\nI live in the city...and I even got a fantastic deal to join another gym and didn't - why? Because City Fitness is the best. They have the best free weight options, machines, they fix things quickly, they have real trainers, and they offer the most extensive services. \\n\\nIt's an environment where people are really actually working on their bodies - you'll see all types, and everyone is really giving it their all - and that's inspirational. \\n\\nI'm glad I renewed my membership...and I look forward to another year!\",\n",
